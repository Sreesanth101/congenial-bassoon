### This is some python code to use .json/text files as a database to store and get json data.

## Features :
#### The database is flexible and movable. It has no signatures/(a particular way to store data) so you can edit your db manually (at your own risk)
#### You can query your data in lists/dictionaries or in json

## Disadvantages:
#### You can't query your data (at least for now)
#### focused on Python only


## Upcoming features:
#### Querying Data
#### Clustering of computers to store data
#### Having a backup DB 
#### CLI/ Terminal Interface
