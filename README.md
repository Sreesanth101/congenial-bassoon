## What is the project about?
The project is to store and query data in text/.json files instead of Databases like Posgres and MongoDB

## Its not a PyPi approved library yet as it is still under development, but you can test it if you like.


## What do you mean by "minors" in your code?
If you want a function/user that only fetches data but does not insert any data, you can create a minor user, there is only one major user (for now), the user that you make while connecting to your database
