# congenial-bassoon
A simple Wrapper/DB library to store and query data, written and meant for python

### btw, ya i do know about json files. this is just to store and query data inside them as if they are databases


## What do you mean by minors in your code?
If you want a function/user that only fetches data but does not insert any data, you can create a minor user, there is only one major user (for now), the user that you make while connecting to your database
